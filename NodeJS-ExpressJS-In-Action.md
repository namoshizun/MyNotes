## Node.JS - Express.JS In Action

### Chapter 1. What is Express?



#### 1.1 What is this Node.JS Bussiness?

**Node.JS is:**

* **<u>*A runtime platform that operates on V8 Javascript engine*</u>** ( But it is not a framework!!! )
* It complements JavaScript with many backend capabilities, such as IO, File System ... ( But it's cumbersome to use these native APIs, so Express came to light just like the jQuery to the native JS )

**Why Node.JS**:

* How cool it is to have just one programming language from the frontend to backend ::smiley:!!!
* It is blazing fast :D. V8 is an awesome engine. 
* It runs JavaScript which naturally supports **<u>*Async Programming*</u>** and hence handles **<u>*concurrency*</u>** nicely and easily. It makes programming easier since you don't have to mangle multi-threads. The server is just faithfully just serving requests and doing messenger work :smiley:
